Shortly after the group's lineup solidified in 1961, a series of wildly successful singles made them superstars, and in the mid-'60s Beatlemania swept the globe. The rest of the decade was defined by fearless experimentation, musical reinvention, and visionary recordings. Years after their 1970 breakup, The Beatles continue to be a keystone influence on countless artists. This selection of unforgettable songs—now highlighting some of the most revelatory tracks from the new super deluxe White Album collection—offers an introduction to the band's towering legacy for new listeners, and an opportunity for longtime fans to fall in love with them all over again.",

Enter The Beatles: always there, always great. “The Beatles are true British icons and musical innovators, and I love how they used their art as a medium to express their progressive thinking,” says Jessica Skye, Apple Fitness+ trainer for Yoga, Mindful Cooldown, and Meditation. “Their music feels like a fusion of rock with rhythm and groovy blues, and their songs add such an uplifting and fun energy to any workout.” So whether you’re doing something high-impact or getting bi’s with a little help from your friends (sorry), try this mix of Beatles tracks compiled by our Apple Music editors and Fitness+ trainers—together, we can work it out. We switch things up here regularly, so if you hear a track you like, add it to your library.",

                            "standard": "“Out of the four members of The Beatles, the one who had the most impact on me was John Lennon,” Radio celebrity Zhang Youdai tells Apple Music. “He changed the world with the messages of love and peace that he spread through his music, and he changed my world too.” Since the early 1990s, the iconic Chinese tastemaker has been DJing for radio stations, festivals, concerts, and podcasts—all according to his self-proclaimed mission to bridge the gap between Chinese and Western music. Here, Zhang has shared the 25 Beatles songs that changed his life. Read on for more on his love for the band.\n\nHis first encounter with The Beatles was characteristic of the difficulties that people in China faced in accessing and understanding Western music at the time of Zhang’s youth. “The first Beatles album I heard was a cassette tape that my friend brought over from Hong Kong. It had a picture of The Beatles stuck on it, but it turned out to be a Filipino band doing Beatles covers. The first song was ‘Yellow Submarine’. I was extremely surprised—it sounded like a nursery rhyme. Then there was ‘Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da’: Why did it sound so merry, like they were playing at a party? Then, ‘Hello, Goodbye’: Why was it so simple? What kind of legends were these? I later realised that this is precisely why they were legends: Their music is a kaleidoscope, an encyclopaedia, a boundless source of treasures and a genuine wealth of riches.” Zhang first heard The (real) Beatles in 1989. “A British friend who was going back home left me with [1964's]Beatles For Sale and a discman,\" he says. \"Every song on that album is imprinted with the memory of that spring.\"\n\nThis false start preceded a journey that gave him his life’s purpose. “My favourite Beatles album is [1968's] The White Album. The most important song was ‘Revolution No. 1’. In the ’60s, young people from East to West were crying out for revolution, yelling slogans, wanting to change the world. Lennon was seen as a spiritual leader for revolutionary youth in the West. On this song, he put forward his own ideas. The song taught me to live a more thoughtful life; not to follow blindly along, but to realise that to change the world you need to open your spirit and free your mind.” Zhang says.\n\nZhang started hosting radio shows and events all over China that revolutionised his listeners’ appreciation of Western music. “'Revolution No. 9' song ought to be seen as a piece of ’60s musical art, rather than a pop song,\" he says. \"Only with Lennon could there be such bold and forward-thinking creativity, going against popular opinion, commercial interests, tradition and The Beatles themselves. If I hadn’t listened to this song, I wouldn’t have become the person I am today.”\n\n“Another song that changed my life is from The Beatles’ last album, [1969's] Abbey Road. It’s part of the Paul McCartney medley, called ‘Carry That Weight’. I was 19 years old when I first heard Paul sing these words to me: ‘Boy you gonna carry that weight for a long time…’ I thought that he was singing to me personally. Everybody has to bear heavy burdens in the process of growing up, and it’s precisely these burdens that allow us to mature and get older. We may carry those burdens into the grave, but this music will live on forever.”\n\n\"I don’t think The Beatles are hugely influential on music within China,\" Zhang says. \"There are not many musicians in China that really understand or get their musical sustenance from The Beatles. It's a big deficiency in Chinese rock and pop. As Beatles fans, we often feel quite lonely; we never find close friends who speak the same language as us, and it makes us feel even more like we have the responsibility and the duty to introduce The Beatles’ music and ideology to more people,” he says. \"For the last half century, people in the music industry have always been talking about ‘the next Beatles’, but there has never been anyone who has managed to take their place in popular music.”",

                            "standard": "Oaeen were Beatles fans way before they became one of C-pop’s biggest bands. In fact, when they were still known as Sodagreen, they made a pilgrimage to Liverpool in 2010 to pay homage. That they’ve been deeply influenced by the Fab Four is a well-known fact, and here, the band have made a playlist of their favourite songs. Read on for rare personal insights into their selections.\n\n“Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds”\n“When I [guitarist Kay Liu] was in college, I watched I Am Sam, a movie that pays tribute to The Beatles and has a soundtrack of Beatles classics. In the story, the father, who has an intellectual disability, is a huge fan and name his daughter Lucy after this song. John Lennon said it’s a tribute to Alice in Wonderland, but rumour has it that it’s actually about psychedelic drugs—LSD is the initials of the song’s title.” – Kay Liu, guitarist\n\n“Blackbird”\n“A short but profound song amid their vast catalogue. ‘Blackbird singing in the dead of night… You were only waiting for this moment to be free’. Behind these touching lyrics, Paul McCartney is playing guitar with only two fingers, making for a very special sound—one that’s different to when a guitarist is intent on showing off their skills. The outcome is fresh, unique and original. It’s Kay’s most played Beatles song.”\n\n“Hey Jude”\n“Yesterday, from 2019, is another movie that pays tribute to The Beatles. The story is set in a world where no one but the protagonist can remember The Beatles. The protagonist plays Beatles songs, pretending they’re his own, and becomes a rock star—even Ed Sheeran has to surrender to his ability to write songs. (There's also a scene where he asks the protagonist to rename ‘Hey Jude’ to ‘Hey Dude’.) It pays tribute to the Beatles in a sweet, hilarious way.”\n\n“The Long And Winding Road”\n“There are disputes over the production and arrangement of this song, but it’s impossible to deny its commercial success. Looking back, it seems like a farce. Does it really suit The Beatles? Does it go against their original creative vision? Regardless, it was their 20th song to top the Billboard charts—and also their last.”\n\n“Strawberry Fields Forever”\n“When I [guitarist Afu] was 30 years old, I had the opportunity to visit Liverpool and go on a Beatles-themed bus tour. The tour guide was telling the story of The Beatles, and we eventually came to the door of a strawberry farm. [Drummer] Wei and I jumped excitedly off the bus, eager to see the inspiration behind the song. But it turned out to be an abandoned-looking red iron gate with ‘Strawberry Field’ written on the wall next to it. ‘Strawberry Fields Forever’ also has a special place in Kay’s heart as The Beatles’ most psychedelic song.” – Afu, guitarist\n\n“Yesterday”\n“‘Yesterday’ is a super classic that many people have re-arranged and covered, but our favourite is the incredibly simple version that they pioneered with just guitar and singing on [1965's] Help!”\n\n“Here Comes the Sun / While My Guitar Gently Weeps”\n“As well as being lead guitarist, George Harrison wrote moving tracks like these. Playing these two songs when you’re in a bad mood is very healing. It’s said that ‘While My Guitar Gently Weeps’ was inspired by the I Ching (Book of Changes), proclaiming a kind of love that is deeply asleep inside of us, while ‘Here Comes the Sun’ celebrates moments where the worst times have passed.”\n\n“Yellow Submarine”\n“[1966's] Revolver has a British rock flavour that still endures today. The album includes ‘Yellow Submarine’, ‘And Your Bird Can Sing’, ‘For No One’, ‘I Want to Tell You’ and ‘Got to Get You into My Life’, all songs worth listening to.”\n\n“Maxwell's Silver Hammer”\n“We’re recommending a lesser-known song. When we recorded the song ‘After Playing’ on Sodagreen’s Daylight of Spring, this was constantly on our mind.”\n\n“All You Need Is Love”\n“We really like the simple side of The Beatles. It’s shocking to think this was released in 1967. How could such a classic song be written more than 50 years ago and still be so relevant today? Love will aways the solution to all things. And, George’s solo in the middle is highly recommended listening.”\n\n“Come Together”\n“‘Come Together’ comes from [1965’s] Abbey Road, where their creative expression was at its peak. This song has reached the point where nobody in the rock scene doesn’t know it. The drums on the right and the bass on the left echo each other from start to finish. The arrangement of the whole song is so simple but so dense, and the music and lyrics also seem to fit together just right.”\n\n“Let It Be”\n“In high school, the music my [Kay’s] classmates were listening to was either the Japanese metal band, X Japan, or American folk artist, Richard Marx. Nobody was listening to The Beatles! I took advantage of a discount at the record store to buy [1970's] Let It Be and I was immediately touched by the melody of the title track. I later realised this was the last song they released, but it was also my first step into their fascinating musical world.”\n\n“A Day In the Life”\n“‘A Day In The Life’ is from [1967's] Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. This was The Beatles’ first concept album. It’s also Wei’s favourite album.”\n\n“Day Tripper”\n“It sounds like a classic ‘60s rock song, with a strong, well-arranged melody. Today, fewer people think about how to create a classic melody progression—but that’s what makes this so impressive.”\n\n“Her Majesty”\n“The special thing about this track, the last on Abbey Road, is that all the sounds gradually pan from far right to far left. Although it’s only 23 seconds long, it leaves a strong impression.”",

                            "standard": "Though Kelly first found fame on TV, The Beatles were an early love—and a major part of her musical consciousness. The Canadian-Chinese artist covered “Let It Be” early in her career, and she's called Paul McCartney her guitar hero. Following the release of her fourth album, Intermezzo, Yu has made a playlist to celebrate her favourite Beatles songs, along with some of her tracks. “I grew up listening to The Beatles and they had a great influence on me. I hope you can spot their influence in my songs.” Kelly tells Apple Music. Read more in the interview below.\n\nHow and when did The Beatles come into your life?\n“I started learning piano when I was four and guitar when I was nine. It was in the process of learning guitar that I gradually came into contact with rock 'n' roll music. After learning acoustic guitar for a year, I went straight into playing the electric guitar, and that's when I came to know a very good and extremely famous guitarist called Paul McCartney. So through him I got to know The Beatles as a band.”\n\nHow did the Beatles inspire you and influence your music?\n“They're very much representative of ’60s popular music. But their music isn’t just pop. From pop to blues to rock ‘n’ roll, and then even to folk and world music, they touched upon them all. .”\n\nWhy did you choose these songs for the playlist?\n“There are a lot of Beatles songs that people hear all the time and know by heart, like ‘Hey Jude’, ‘Yesterday’, ‘Let It Be’, and ‘Yellow Submarine’. But they have so many songs some people might not have heard yet. I wanted to use this opportunity to introduce people to some of their other songs. ‘Across the Universe’, ‘While My Guitar Gently Weeps’, and ‘Strawberry Fields Forever’, for example, are some classics that people perhaps don’t get to hear very often.”\n\nThe playlist is generally upbeat and uplifting, you there are melancholy songs like “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” and “Eleanor Rigby”. Tell us about those songs?\n“I wanted to show their variety. The tone of a playlist to do with this band isn’t limited to the pop songs everyone is used to hearing. Their strength was in their range. For example, ‘Blackbird’ leans towards folk, songs like ‘Can’t Buy Me Love’ and ‘Roll Over Beethoven’ are very bluesy, and ‘Help!’ is more rock 'n' roll. It’s hard to find bands that can stretch across so many styles and execute them all perfectly.”",

                            "standard": "The dissolution of The Beatles was a famously unpleasant situation: By 1968, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were sometimes working simultaneously in separate studios; only about half of the White Album’s songs featured the full band. Conceived by McCartney as an effort to reclaim the band’s marital groove, <i>Let It Be</i> presented The Beatles not as an elaborate studio art project but as four guys making music together in a room.<br />\nFor as divisive as Phil Spector’s 11th-hour contributions were (George Martin joked that he should be given a credit for production, while Spector should get one for overproduction), they were also overstated: Only a handful of tracks here—most notably Lennon’s “Across the Universe” and McCartney’s “The Long and Winding Road”—were all that heavily orchestrated. While some were chopped up and reassembled to get a better shape, the rest of the album (“Get Back”; George Harrison’s breezy “For You Blue”; the surrealistic blues of Lennon’s “Dig a Pony,” recorded live on the rooftop of the band’s Apple Corps offices) hewed more or less to what McCartney had envisioned: The Beatles rediscovering the poise and spontaneity of a great live band. (“Let It Be” was a relatively big production even before Spector came on board.)<br />\nStill, it’s a bittersweet, sometimes uncomfortable listen, and only further muddled by the eternal debate of whether or not it was actually the band’s last album, having been more or less finished before <i>Abbey Road</i> was started but not released until the band had broken up about a year later. (“And now we’d like to do ‘Hark, the Angels Come!’” Lennon squeaks in falsetto before “Let It Be”—a jab at what he felt was McCartney’s sodden pseudo-religiosity.) Still, listen and you can hear the heart, humor, and camaraderie that made them so unusual to begin with: McCartney’s “Two of Us,” the throwback “One After 909,” the eternal “Get Back.”<br />\nIn September 1969, Lennon quit. <i>Abbey Road</i> came out about a week later. McCartney effectively quit the following April, and put out his first solo record, <i>McCartney</i>, about a week later. In a self-interview that doubled as album promotion and carefully worded statement of personal independence, McCartney said that his only immediate plans were to grow up.",

The album was a stark contrast to <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> in every aspect—from the cover art to the sounds within. The sheer breadth of material as well as the mixture of the loud and the soft is part of what makes \"The White Album\" so surprising. The heavy sounds of \"Helter Skelter\" and \"Yer Blues\" juxtapose with the gentle beauty of \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"Julia.\" The cacophony of \"Revolution 9\" is followed by the orchestral lullaby of \"Good Night.\" The album's extended length gave the band room in which they could explore all of their musical influences and multiple forms of popular music, while creating revolutionary sounds in the studio.",

                            "standard": "While it’s romantic to imagine that <i>Revolver</i> was a bolt of genius that arrived without context or precedent, the reality is more interesting. Sometime in 1965, The Beatles' longtime producer George Martin quit his contract with EMI Records. Martin had been working at a flat rate, without royalties—in other words, he would’ve made what he made no matter how well the band did. Martin knew EMI wouldn’t risk jeopardizing the band’s streak, and in leaving, he essentially forced the company to pay him what he was worth. That EMI owned the studios at Abbey Road outright meant The Beatles could record more or less as much as they wanted—an opportunity that, coupled with their increasing reluctance to tour, marked an existential shift in orientation: The Beatles were a studio band now.<br />\nWhat was once a refuge (the band liked recording in part because it gave them a break from the fatigue of touring and public fame) turned into a hub of inspiration. Some results were obvious: the wild tape-loop collages of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” or George Harrison's guitar solo on “I’m Only Sleeping,” made during a six-hour session in which the part was transcribed in reverse by Martin, then recorded with the tape playing backward so as to make the final product sound like it was being sucked out from inside the song. Others—compression, Leslie speakers that gave vocals a liquid, sloshing quality, and automatic double-tracking capacity that allowed the band to split signals across the stereo field and give the recordings new spatial dimension—were subtler, but in all cases pointed to a supremacy of sound for sound’s sake. The pastiche of faces and lack of band attribution on the album’s cover drove home the point: For all the 300-something hours that went into the album’s recording, it’s hard to picture <i>Revolver</i> being made by four guys standing in a room.<br />\nWhile McCartney was getting more interested in characters and scenarios (“For No One,” “Eleanor Rigby”), Lennon—then starting to steep in LSD—was withdrawing into the mysteries of the self (“She Said She Said,” “Tomorrow Never Knows”). Harrison, previously a little peripheral, found not only a voice, but range: Compare the serrated R&B of “Taxman” to the Indian drones of “Love You To”—a contrast as stark as any in the band’s catalog.<br />\nIn a way, it’s understandable why the album was considered minor compared to <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> for so long: <i>Pepper’s</i> had a rambling, mythic quality that made it seem like something more than just a set of songs, while <i>Revolver</i> was still essentially following the rubric of <i>Rubber Soul</i>—a compact set of tracks meant to show the best ideas the band had. But if <i>Pepper’s</i> liberated the concept of the big, sprawling rock album, <i>Revolver</i> still speaks to how we understand 21st-century pop: fragmented, super eclectic, each song a fully saturated mood different from the one three minutes in either direction. Where <i>Pepper’s</i> ambled, <i>Revolver</i> honored the entertainer’s timeless responsibility to grab you by the ears.<br />\nLess than a week after the album was released, the band held a press conference at the Astor Hotel in Chicago, where Lennon was inevitably forced to clarify his observation from the previous March that The Beatles had become more popular than Jesus—a comment controversial enough to be publicly denounced by the Vatican, who noted that some subjects should be respected even by beatniks. A few questions later, a member of the press noted—respectfully in both directions—that Jesus probably would have appreciated “Eleanor Rigby.” Lennon, so exhausted and troubled by the ordeal that he’d broken down in tears while preparing to meet the reporters, demurred.",

                            "standard": "It wasn’t just that <i>Rubber Soul</i> was sonically groundbreaking (it was), or that Lennon and McCartney’s songwriting had reached new heights of maturity and ambiguity (okay), but that it was the first Beatles album where each song seemed to exist unto itself and yet worked in alchemical harmony with everything around it: the emergence of the pop album as creative kaleidoscope.<br />\nMcCartney had told the <i>New Musical Express</i> that the band was banking on comedy being the next big thing after protest music—a reflection, possibly, of the existential irreverence one feels on acid, their growing insularity from (and reluctance toward) the culture at large, a philosophical commitment to enjoying the ride, or some giddy mix of all three.<br />\nWhatever the case, <i>Rubber Soul</i> is a deeply funny album: the gender play of “Drive My Car” (and the <i>beep-beep</i> backing vocals), the cabaret of “Michelle” (because nothing warms up the object of one’s desire like French), the way Lennon sucks deeply through his teeth before oozing the chorus to “Girl.” Even the album’s most earnest songs (“Nowhere Man,” “In My Life”) were touched by a nursery-rhyme gentleness that made their themes (psychic alienation, the astonishing continuity of past and present) go down easily. As for “Norwegian Wood,” what can you really do with the suggestion that the narrator burns the girl’s house down but shrug in uncertainty? This is how the album unfolds: colorful, dreamy, and delirious on the surface, with shadows swimming underneath.<br />\nThe overall feeling is one of liberation: In getting a little chemical-assisted distance from their egos, the band was able to explore style in ways that felt fluid and radical, changing costumes from song to song instead of locking themselves continuously into being The Beatles—a channel-changing approach that only became more pronounced as their career wound on (especially on the White Album and <i>Abbey Road</i>), not to mention set a new precedent for the diversity of modes and expressions pop artists were suddenly allowed to explore. As for the title, McCartney had remembered something an old bluesman said about Mick Jagger—that he was “plastic soul.” In the original iteration, it was a diss; in The Beatles’ version, it was a statement of liberation: In embracing artifice, you free yourself from the confines of the real.",

Lennon, in particular, was miserable: drinking a lot, numbed out, riding the tail of a crumbling marriage for which he had plenty to atone from a 17-room mansion adjacent to a golf course over which he’d never imagined living—a stretch he later called his “Fat Elvis” period.<br />\nWhere <i>Beatles For Sale</i> had captured the vitality of angry young men, the songs on <i>Help!</i>—Lennon’s “Help!” and “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away,” McCartney’s “Yesterday” and “I’ve Just Seen a Face”—felt naked to the point of abstraction, the heat of the feelings stripped away to reveal something pining, innocent, planted on the ground but strangely displaced: alienation without angst.<br />\nCannabis, which the band had been smoking with heroic regularity, probably didn’t hurt: You had the sense that they were singing not from themselves, but about themselves, even <i>to</i> themselves, pieces on a great existential chessboard observed from a place of melancholic remove. (McCartney said the drug made him feel like he was thinking for the first time; Ringo, recalling the filming of the movie that accompanied this album, said—in charming Ringo fashion—that the crew got used to the fact that the band didn’t get much done after lunch.) Even Ringo’s “Act Naturally”—a lighthearted, Kinks-y country song—seemed tinted by a new, more ruminative frame of mind: The guy in the song is an actor playing himself.<br />\nAnd while you could still hear the sweaty club band lurking underneath (“Dizzy Miss Lizzy,” “Help!”), most of the album tilted toward classical austerity: “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away” was the band’s first fully acoustic arrangement (and featured the eternally un-rock sound of flutes); “Yesterday”—a song that seemed so comforting and eternal that McCartney was reportedly haunted by the feeling that it had somehow, somewhere already been written—had a string quartet (a move suggested to a hesitant McCartney by producer George Martin). Having spent their youth in extroversion, the Beatles were turning inward.<br />\nAbout a week after the album came out, the band played a show to 56,000 screaming people at Shea Stadium, a scenario and scale so unprecedented that Vox had designed special amplifiers for the event. A week or so after that, they took a few much-needed days off at a rented house in Beverly Hills (featuring a moat and a drawbridge), only to be discovered by four teenage female fans. When security guards turned the girls away, they went home, opened the Yellow Pages, and rented a helicopter. <i>Help!</i>—that sounds right.",

                            "standard": "Driving through Colorado during a road trip in early 1964, Bob Dylan heard a rundown of the country’s Top 10 singles, more than half of which were by The Beatles. By then, the band had saturated America with the same bizarre speed they’d saturated England, first broadcast on American radio about a week before Christmas 1963 by a Washington, D.C.-area DJ whose friend—a flight attendant for BOAC—had brought a copy of “I Want to Hold Your Hand” over in their luggage, essentially unplugging the last finger holding back a transatlantic flood.<br />\nWhether or not Dylan liked the band’s music was unclear. (We’re talking about Bob Dylan here.) What he did acknowledge was that their sound—the energy, the harmonic language, the combination of universally appealing but unprecedented—was somehow inevitable; that they pointed the direction of where music <i>had</i> to go.<br />\nAt the time, folk—Dylan’s province—was considered part of a vanguard; in jazz, composers like John Coltrane had already signaled a move toward abstraction; in visual art, pop had happily unseated the macho hugeness of abstract expressionism; independent filmmaking was developing a momentum. In other words, where other cultural avenues had taken new directions, pop music had mostly stayed the course.<br />\nReleased in summer 1964 (only a year and change after <i>Please Please Me</i>), <i>A Hard Day’s Night</i> was arguably the first glimpse of our modern idea of The Beatles: safe but a little strange; warm but with shades of bleakness; a band that experimented tirelessly without ever leaving the mainstream. Famously, it was the first time that Lennon and McCartney had written all of the album’s songs, a gesture that set the precedent for the then-new idea that pop (and, by extension, the musicians who made it) wasn’t just a vehicle for a good show, but art that revealed some otherwise inexpressible part of the artist’s soul—something personal.<br />\nThe music was more evolved too. What had, on their first couple of albums, been borrowed from R&B and soul covers became baked into their own compositions: the workaday relief of the title track, the blues morality of “Can’t Buy Me Love” (covered, almost immediately, by Ella Fitzgerald). Lennon’s “I’ll Be Back” was the moodiest song they’d ever recorded, McCartney’s “And I Love Her” the most nakedly open-hearted, capturing a shadow-and-light quality that was warm but stark—contrasts new not just for their songwriting, but for ’60s pop in general.<br />\nThat the album had originally been conceived of as a soundtrack for a United Artists movie designed to capitalize on The Beatles’ fame in England (Capitol had been famously reticent to release their albums in the United States) is an illustration of just how swiftly the machine’s gears were turning; that the band managed to make not only the album but also the movie as charming and sneakily creative as they did is—well, you see where they got their good reputation.",

                            "standard": "Though wedged between the comparatively giant <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> and 1968’s White Album, <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> nevertheless played a part in The Beatles' story, and put a cap on a year in which the band made yet more music nobody was totally prepared for them to make. The album was released as a companion to a meandering, band-directed movie, and its first half is probably one of the lowest-stakes sides in the band’s catalog—a relief, in a way, from how high-stakes their music had become. Still, this was The Beatles in 1967—momentum was strong. What had started out as a string of acid playground rhymes turned into Lennon’s angriest song this side of 1970 (“I Am the Walrus”), while McCartney’s simple sentimentality had taken on a quality that felt stoic, almost abstract (“The Fool on the Hill”). There was a rare instrumental (“Flying”), a foggy Harrison drone (“Blue Jay Way”), and an invocation of the past by McCartney that blurred lines between sweet and eerie (“Your Mother Should Know”).<br />\nWhile the band had helped rechristen the album format as an artistic statement unto itself, they were still releasing singles—as in tracks that weren’t associated with any album. Designed primarily as a consumer service, the second half of <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> collected what they’d offered in 1967. The yin-yang of McCartney’s “Penny Lane” and Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever” (originally released on the same 7-inch record) arguably says more about what ground the band covered in seven minutes than any other two songs in their catalog—the former baroque, charming, and upbeat; the latter dense and melancholy—variations on a theme of seemingly simple pasts refracted, dreamlike, through the present. And if “I Am the Walrus” was Lennon’s dark foray into contradiction and surreality, McCartney’s “Hello, Goodbye” was its bright counterpart. “Baby, You’re a Rich Man” probably doesn’t get the credit it deserves. “All You Need Is Love,” debuted to an estimated 400 million people in the world’s first live international satellite TV production (<i>Our World</i>), did receive wide acclaim, and while cynicism and embarrassment about 1967’s Summer of Love would set in as soon as a few years later, it probably deserves more.<br />\nAs for the movie that gave the album its name, press coverage of it was so uniformly hostile (not to mention viewer feedback to the BBC switchboard so sustained) that McCartney went on the BBC the day after it first aired to defuse the tension. Asked why he thought people didn’t like it, McCartney said he wasn’t sure—he liked it fine.",

Their first single, “Love Me Do,” had fared pretty well, but was considered a little rough next to the soppy, Broadway-influenced stuff that constituted English pop at the time. Their second, “Please Please Me,” seemed like more of a sure bet: Simpler, sweeter, something to get the kids’ blood going. (After asking John Lennon to overdub harmonica on top of George Harrison’s guitar line, producer George Martin congratulated the band from the control room on their first Number One.)<br />\nA few weeks later, as the national mind was cheerfully unraveling, the band went into the studio for a 10 am session at Martin's urging, and, about 13 hours and countless cigarettes and Zubes cough drops later (Lennon had a cold), finished their first album—essentially a studio snapshot of the material they’d been playing at The Cavern Club in Liverpool, right down to the set-opening count-off.<br />\nThat much of it was Black American R&B and soul—Arthur Alexander’s “Anna (Go To Him),” Gerry Goffin and Carole King’s “Chains” (popularized by The Cookies), The Isley Brothers’ “Twist and Shout” (the day’s last take, hence Lennon’s shredded larynx)—was novel, if not straight-up aberrant, especially when framed in such spartan sonic terms. (Bless The Everly Brothers and Bobby Darin; <i>Please Please Me</i> was neither.) That Lennon and McCartney’s originals showed such innate versatility—polite then raw, buttoned-up then scandalously loose, a synthesis of American rock, pop, and soul played with teenage guile and veteran poise—was cause for the culture to take a deep breath. (“Between them The Beatles adopt a do-it-yourself approach from the very beginning,” the album’s sleeve notes chirped. “They write their own lyrics, design and eventually build their own instrumental backdrops and work out their own vocal arrangements.”)<br />\nThe morning after the session, the band resumed their position as fourth slot on an 11-act bill supporting a 16-year-old pop singer named Helen Shapiro. (Lennon’s voice hadn’t healed; George and Paul did most of the singing.) <i>Please Please Me</i>—yes, The Beatles’ first album—was rush-released that March and stayed at the top of the charts for about six months. It was replaced by their second.",

                            "standard": "The dissolution of The Beatles was a famously unpleasant situation: By 1968, Lennon and McCartney were sometimes working simultaneously in separate studios; only about half of the White Album’s songs featured the full band. Conceived by McCartney as an effort to reclaim the band’s marital groove, <i>Let It Be</i> presented The Beatles not as an elaborate studio art project but as four guys making music together in a room.<br />\nFor as divisive as Phil Spector’s 11th-hour contributions were (George Martin joked that he should be given a credit for production, while Spector should get one for overproduction), they were also overstated: Only a handful of tracks here—most notably Lennon’s “Across the Universe” and McCartney’s “The Long and Winding Road”—were all that heavily orchestrated. While some were chopped up and reassembled to get a better shape, the rest of the album (“Get Back,” George Harrison’s breezy “For You Blue,” the surrealistic blues of Lennon’s “Dig a Pony,” recorded live on the rooftop of the band’s Apple Corps offices) hewed more or less to what McCartney had envisioned: The Beatles rediscovering the poise and spontaneity of a great live band. (“Let It Be” was a relatively big production even before Spector came on board.)<br />\nStill, it’s a bittersweet, sometimes uncomfortable listen, and only further muddled by the eternal debate of whether or not it was actually the band’s last album, having been more or less finished before <i>Abbey Road</i> was started but not released until the band had broken up about a year later. (“And now we’d like to do ‘Hark, the Angels Come!’” Lennon squeaks in falsetto before “Let It Be”—a jab at what he felt was Paul’s sodden pseudo-religiosity.) Still, listen and you can still hear the heart, humor, and camaraderie that made them so unusual to begin with: McCartney’s “Two of Us,” the throwback “One After 909,” the eternal “Get Back.”<br />\nIn September 1969, Lennon quit. <i>Abbey Road</i> came out about a week later. McCartney effectively quit the following April, and put out his first solo record, <i>McCartney</i>, about a week later. In a self-interview that doubled as album promotion and carefully worded statement of personal independence, McCartney said that his only immediate plans were to grow up.",

                            "standard": "The Beatles didn’t get a lot of breathing room in 1963: In February, they had to be smuggled out of a show in Carlisle in a post office van by a police sergeant disguised as a mail carrier; by November, a couple of weeks before the release of their second album, <i>With the Beatles</i>, a riot broke out after fans <i>pushed a parked car</i> into a line of police officers trying to enforce a cordon outside a show in Dublin. Though the precise coinage is still debated, the word “Beatlemania” entered the public lexicon in October; at a couple of live shows, the band reportedly stopped being able to hear their instruments over the sound of the screaming.<br />\nWhile the bulk of <i>Please Please Me</i> had been recorded in a single 13-hour session, <i>With the Beatles</i> was recorded in seven sessions over three months—a schedule that seems comparatively luxurious until you realize that every session took place on days between tour dates or other travel-oriented obligations, and in at least one case, straddled a three-and-a-half-hour stretch in the middle of the day during which the band drove to a theater several miles from the studio to record both an interview <i>and</i> a session for the BBC. In London traffic. On a Tuesday. Oh, and they wrote most of the songs, too, and in some mysterious hour during which the accomplished accomplish things, they learned to play them as well.<br />\nAnd so here they were again: Moody on the album cover (a black-and-white Robert Freeman photo inspired by Freeman’s images of John Coltrane), bright and unruffled in the music. Like <i>Please Please Me</i>, about half of <i>With the Beatles</i> was made up of covers of American soul and R&B (The Marvelettes’ “Please Mr. Postman,” Smokey Robinson’s “You Really Got a Hold on Me”), while half were Lennon and/or McCartney originals. If Lennon was emerging as the band’s ironist (Barrett Strong’s “Money [That’s What I Want]”), McCartney was becoming their moony romantic (<i>The Music Man</i> highlight “Till There Was You”)—a yin-yang balance that lasted the duration of their shared career. (At the <i>Royal Variety Performance</i> in early November, Lennon famously encouraged the people in the cheap seats to clap along and the rest of the audience—which included the Queen—“rattle your jewelry.”)<br />\nWhile still basically a youth band, they’d started to get dues from the establishment, too: A couple of days before Christmas, a critic for <i>The Times</i> said they were the finest English composers of the year, noting that they seemed to think simultaneously of harmony <i>and</i> melody, while also singling out the naturalness of their Aeolian cadences and intriguing pandiatonic clusters, none of which mattered to the hoarse-voiced teenagers squatted for days outside ticket booths, but which signaled the possibility that the band was on the brink of universal appeal: pop music handled with the sanctity of art.",

                            "standard": "By the end of 1964, The Beatles were exhausted. In June, they took their first world tour, traveling from Denmark to the Netherlands, then to Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, often playing two shows a day to make good on the trip. Between mid-August and late September, they played 30 shows in 23 US cities, getting an introduction to pot from Bob Dylan in New York and, a couple of weeks later, drunkenly confessing their mutual love for each other while waiting out a hurricane in Key West—a night later recalled by Paul McCartney on 1982’s John Lennon remembrance “Here Today.” Their fame was inarguable, their pace unsupportable.<br />\nSo while attributing any real cynicism to the title <i>Beatles for Sale</i> is probably a stretch, it’s not out of the ballpark—they were, on some level, a commodity, and finally feeling the squeeze of being trafficked like one. Here’s the first time you get to hear The Beatles really yell, not once (the snarling middle section of Lennon’s “No Reply”) but twice (the background vocals on “What You’re Doing”). Lennon’s songs in particular—“I’m a Loser,” “I Don’t Want to Spoil the Party” (“I’ve had a drink or two and I don’t care”), the bleakly jealous “No Reply”—showed a writer giving himself over to his least marketable moods.<br />\nUnable to balance the demands of writing with touring and general fame, they fell back on covers: Chuck Berry’s “Rock and Roll Music,” Buddy Holly’s “Words of Love,” “Mr. Moonlight.” It was rock and R&B that stood in sharper contrast to their originals than on previous albums, but which—along with the LP’s country inflections—helped extend the band’s dialogue with distinctly American music. And they managed to brighten up enough to work in “Eight Days a Week.”",

                            "standard": "For better and worse, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> helped set the precedent that rock bands could (and should) do more or less whatever they wanted. Songs got longer, albums grew concepts, and the idea of the LP as a concise product meant to showcase a performer’s talents gave way to the suspicion that commercial concerns ultimately only served The Man. A few months before The Beatles were set to record <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>, Bob Dylan had released <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>, an album so expansive it had to literally be pressed onto two records, while The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i> stretched the dimensions and possibilities of the three-minute pop song. McCartney in particular had been fascinated by things like Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention’s 1966 debut, <i>Freak Out!</i>, a double album whose hodgepodge of songs, noise, skits, and sound gags mirrored conceptual art’s breaking of the painterly frame. Where The Beatles had once sought to distill and consolidate, now they were looking to expand. McCartney had even come up with an alter ego and pseudo-unifying backstory—a move Lennon later said only worked because the band <i>said</i> it worked. In other words, they didn’t want to just exorcise the group that made “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” they wanted to smother them with a pillow. Vacationing in France just before recording had started, McCartney slicked his hair back with Vaseline and wandered the streets in a fake mustache and clear-lens glasses, an experience he called “quite liberating.”<br />\nFor all its experiments (“A Day in the Life”) and invocations of the counterculture (“Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds”), it’s probably the band’s most conservative album: the beer hall sing-alongs of the title track and “With a Little Help From My Friends,” the old-timey entertainments of “Being for the Benefit of Mister Kite!,” the domestic contentment of “When I’m Sixty-Four.” Like The Kinks circa “Waterloo Sunset” and <i>The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</i> and The Beach Boys of <i>Smiley Smile</i>, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> is an album that looked toward the past instead of the future, the work of guys in their late twenties starting to wonder if they’d been too eager to break from the old world—or at least might have lost something along the way. (Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever,” recorded around the same time, covered similar themes; that the band was all taking acid—a drug that has a way of flattening geologic time—probably didn’t hurt either.) Even Lennon’s lyric on “A Day in the Life”—“I read the news today, oh boy”—rang with a cosmic quaintness, an image not of young radicals on the loose but of the aging souls of “Eleanor Rigby,” finding infinite richness in a narrow life. A couple of months after the album was released, the band—along with partners, children, and business infrastructure—traveled to Greece with the vague intention of buying an island for everyone to live on, but eventually managed to think better of it.",

                            "standard": "Because The Beatles were so central in developing our concept of the album as a unified statement of artistic purpose, it’s easy to forget that they started their career at a time when most artists measured success in stand-alone singles. “I Want to Hold Your Hand”? Not on a Beatles album—at least not in the UK. (Capitol repurposed some of the band’s early material in the US, but hodgepodge.) Ditto “She Loves You,” and “Day Tripper,” and “Paperback Writer.” Even after <i>Revolver</i> and <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> helped redefine the boundaries of what albums could do, the band still saved some of their best material for singles: “Get Back,” “The Ballad of John and Yoko,” the eternally cathartic “Hey Jude.” (As to the latter in particular, producer George Martin worried that radio wouldn’t play a seven-minute-long single, to which Lennon—never exactly meek, especially by 1968—said, “They will if it’s us.”)<br />\nAs a collection, <i>Past Masters</i> serves the separate function of summarizing the short career of a singularly dynamic band. Like vast country seen from the window of a plane, things move quickly and at geologic scale: the early club years, Beatlemania, the advent of psychedelia, the imperial phase of the late '60s, the rootsy autumn—90 minutes, eight years, a microcosm of rock music in its radical adolescence. And to think they started stamping it out as nothing more than product.",

                            "standard": "In The Beatles’ long and winding history, their self-titled 1968 album is considered by many to be the beginning of the end. Not musically, of course—raw and sprawling, “The White Album” contains some of their richest and most enduring songs—but insofar as the LP showed they were starting to work and develop distinct styles apart from one another. But to hear Giles Martin, son of the late longtime Beatles producer George Martin, tell it, the truth may be more complicated. His evidence: This new 107-track collection he has overseen, featuring a fresh mix of the original album, freewheeling studio outtakes, and the 27 holy-grail acoustic “Esher demos” largely recorded at George Harrison’s house following the band’s consciousness-expanding off-site in India. To Martin, these loose, candid recordings show a band playing off one another’s chemistry in the studio, working together with humor and camaraderie to spare. “You can’t make a record like ‘The White Album’ if you’re arguing,” he says. Martin tells Apple Music which tracks best prove his theory, and how this set offers insight for completists and casual fans alike.<br />\n<b>Julia</b> \n“There’s a version where John plays for my dad and he’s trying to work out whether to fingerpick it or strum it, and you hear them having a conversation. No one even knew this existed, because it was on the back end of a tape with no name on it. When Paul came in, this was the first thing he wanted to listen to, because he was there with John when they were recording it. And it’s like, ‘Wait a second—I thought you all went to different studios...’”<br />\n<b>Cry Baby Cry</b> \n“We have the acoustic version which John sings for the Esher demos, and then there’s a version on the outtakes which is almost like Pink Floyd. The final mix we did actually sounds more like the demo in some ways. They really valued each other as musicians and contributors to everything they did, and that’s what you hear in ‘The White Album’—the way the other members of the band added to the record to create the final version.”<br />\n<b>Happiness Is a Warm Gun</b> \n“There’s conversations you hear after a number of takes where John says to George, ‘It’s getting better, but it’s not getting any easier, or it’s not getting any more fun.’ And George goes, ‘But it’s getting better <i>and</i> it’s getting more fun.’” <br />\n<b>Blackbird</b> \n“You hear Paul working out the way he’s going to sing it, and that’s the beauty of this: We live in a world where everything has to be perfect and you forget that great music is made mainly by people and by voices and by instruments in a room. And by listening to this body of material, you realize it’s actually simple—if you’re very good—to make a very good record. It’s just that, sadly, not many of us are very good.”",

                            "standard": "“<i>Abbey Road</i> as a whole, as an album, is a very good gateway to the rest of the Beatles universe,” producer Giles Martin tells Apple Music. “Because it's the most contemporary-sounding album. It doesn't sound like it was recorded in the '60s.” What the album does sound like—and how it got to sound that way—is of particular interest to Martin, whose late father George was the Fab Four's original producer. And as he did with the 50th anniversary reissues of <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> in 2017 and the White Album in 2018, Martin has painstakingly rebuilt The Beatles' 11th and penultimate album piece by piece, and also unearthed a trove of demos and alternate tracks. (A highlight of the latter includes the band bantering about noise complaints from Abbey Road neighbors while recording “I Want You [She's So Heavy]”.)<br />\nThe goal of the project is not just to appeal to Beatles obsessives, but also to recontextualize what the album means for a contemporary audience and to upgrade the sonic fidelity to match what they are used to hearing. “One of the things we strive for in doing these mixes is so that when people listen to, say, Apple Music, you can have a playlist or a radio station with The Beatles next to Ed Sheeran. I'm interested in seeing if you can switch someone from hearing to listening; audiophiles listen to mixes and people listen to songs. I would love younger generations, or new listeners, or people who weren't aware, to go back and listen to The Beatles. They are the bedrock of popular music for so many people.” To help wade through the embarrassment of riches, Martin highlights a handful of tracks that best show The Beatles in this last unified moment before fracturing, and that are most revelatory in newly remixed form.<br />\n<b>Come Together</b>\n“One of the toughest songs to mix. The reason why is because it's so simple—there's not much on it. It's the band playing live, and it's one of their greatest performances. It's the one track that Ringo and Paul said to me, 'We were really good on this day.' It shows a sophistication as far as playing goes, how far The Beatles have come—they're basically taking what was originally a blues song and completely standing it on its head. The first thing we normally do when we remix Beatles stuff is we put the drums in the center. With 'Come Together,' we did that, and then it just didn't sound as good. So we actually took each individual drum hit and we panned the drums. They move from right to left, or right to center. On the original, they just stand in place.”<br />\n<b>Here Comes the Sun</b> \n“The biggest streaming Beatles song, the one that's the most listened to. It has a slightly more contemporary feel; it's acoustic. The one thing that the new mix of <i>Abbey Road</i> shows off is how good their backing vocals were.”<br />\n<b>I Want You (She’s So Heavy) [Trident Recording Session & Reduction Mix]</b>\n“There's so much written about how these records are created and what microphones they used and what my father's role was and what trousers people were wearing, et cetera. What excites me is when you hear someone talking and just being a guy in a studio making a piece of music that will last 50 years and beyond. What makes it great is the empathy that they have for the outside world: 'Okay, we'll do one more loud one and then we'll do one more'—and that was John Lennon, the angriest Beatle. That's why I do love the beauty of this: Great records are made by humans. They're not made by machine. The thing I look for in the demos is humanity—the creation and the sparks you hear that made the records you love.”<br />\n<b>Something (Studio Demo)</b>\n“Some demos are kind of strange. The thing about George is that there was a fragility to what he did. My dad would say that he never gave George enough time. He deserved more attention, and there is no doubt that George thought he deserved more attention as well. But George was considered a tapestry maker. He'd be in the corner with a needle and thread, working away on his music, and be very precise about things. And you get that from some demos.”<br />\n<b>The End</b>\n“The original is in mono—what we do is play the orchestra back in the studio and create a stereo sound piece. The guitar solos at the end are obviously Paul, John, and George, all playing on one track. We now separate them so you have them left-center-right, and that's probably how they were standing when they recorded them in the studio. Again, that's what I get back to: What we're trying to do is get closer to the performance. When anyone listens to <i>Abbey Road</i>, they should realize that they did play it live. They loved each other, and people can hear that now.”",
