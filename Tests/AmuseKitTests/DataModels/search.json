Yes, the Indiana-born musical prodigy's albums sold like kitchen appliances in the ‘80s, but more importantly, the lifelong showman sang as if every breath were his last. He out-discoed disco. He used elements of R&B, soul, funk, blues, rock, and gospel to turn sonic emotion into genre set pieces, like how “Thriller” morphed fear into horr-opera. MJ even invented his own onomatopoeic language—“Hee hee”; “Chi-ooh!”; “Ow!”—all of which instantly conjure a snapped fedora. Even among the Greatest of All Time, the King of Pop stands apart.",

                            "standard": "<i>Thriller</i>’s late-1982 release marked the beginning of Michael Jackson’s entry into another level of fame; it also saw the end of a great five-year period of creativity that had seen him raise his solo game on the unstoppable <i>Off the Wall</i> and make heavy contributions to the Jacksons’ <i>Destiny</i> and <i>Triumph</i>. Stripping the weight of history from <i>Thriller</i> is a big job, but hearing the record as a statement in itself remains hugely rewarding. Seven of its nine original cuts were Top Ten singles, but more important is the way Jackson and producer Quincy Jones turned the singer’s obsessions into intricate, stunningly sung pop-funk. From the knowing humor of the title track to the dread of “Billie Jean” and “Beat It” and the irresistible cuteness of “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)” and “Baby Be Mine,” <i>Thriller</i> finds Jackson at an artistic height. A quarter century later, it still sells. And nostalgia is far down the list of reasons why. ",

As the first music released after Jackson's legal controversies had been made public, <i>HIStory</i> features a number of new songs that sound defensive, paranoid, and like a man in crisis. Even the nervous beats on \"They Don't Care About Us\" sound as jittery as the original lyrics, which had led to allegations of anti-Semitism and were removed at Jackson's expense. His cover of The Beatles' \"Come Together\" takes on added promise and bite. Sister Janet joins him for \"Scream,\" where their voices blend as one. R. Kelly's \"You Are Not Alone\" illustrates Michael's inimitable way with a ballad. Throw in such hits as \"Rock with You,\" \"Beat It,\" and \"Billie Jean\" on the other half, and <i>HIStory</i> is quite a collection."

Stripping the weight of history from <i>Thriller</i> is a big job, but hearing the record as a statement in itself remains hugely rewarding. Seven of its nine original cuts were Top Ten singles, but more important is the way Jackson and producer Quincy Jones turned the singer’s obsessions into intricate, stunningly sung pop-funk. From the knowing humor of the title track to the dread of “Billie Jean” and “Beat It” and the irresistible cuteness of “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)” and “Baby Be Mine,” <i>Thriller</i> finds Jackson at an artistic height. A quarter century later, it still sells. And nostalgia is far down the list of reasons why. This special edition includes “Someone in the Dark” from an <i>E.T.</i> story album, a “Billie Jean” demo, outtakes and numerous intriguing, amusing interview segments with Jones and songwriting collaborator Rod Temperton.",

After all, it was <i>Off the Wall</i>—Jackson’s fifth studio album—that signaled a new era had arrived for MJ. With producer Quincy Jones, young Jackson resculpted his music to be among pop's most innovative and exciting. From the irresistible grooves of “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” it was apparent that Jackson’s magic had modern, lasting potential. The follow-up album, <i>Thriller</i>, more than proved that point, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time. Each follow-up album was first compared to <i>Thriller</i> before being accepted as its own work, and albums such as <i>Bad</i>, <i>Dangerous</i>, <i>HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I</i>, the subsequent <i>Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix</i>, and finally Invincible all have defining moments that will continue to thrill future generations as Jackson is rediscovered by new audiences.",

The reasons were many, but the pairing of new material with an album of greatest hits had blunted the public's perception of the set as a new release. So Jackson went back into the studio and remixed eight of the songs and added five new tracks. However, this only served to confuse the non-fanatic portion of Jackson's audience further. It's a shame, since Jackson shows no letup in intensity here. \"Morphine\" is tough and edgy and even more frightening in light of the circumstances surrounding his death. \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" is a solid club track, and the classic club mix of R. Kelly's \"You Are Not Alone\" brings a new dimension to one of the original album's best-known songs."

Gordy put his A-team together for Jackson's 1972 solo debut, and three U.S. hit singles—the title track, \"Rockin' Robin,\" and \"I Wanna Be Where You Are\"—justified his faith and efforts. The young Michael shows incredible vocal range on \"Maria (You Were the Only One)\" and sings Bill Withers' \"Ain't No Sunshine\" and Carole King's \"You've Got a Friend\" with sensitivity and craft, beyond the songs' obvious purpose to fill the album with popular hits of the day. The entire album has a consistent early-'70s feel; it's the commercial side of a sound that was often used for sociopolitical material by the adult soul music stars of the era. Jackson's take on The Supremes' 1967 hit \"Love Is Here and Now You're Gone\" and the in-house Motown track \"Wings of My Love\" are easy adaptations for him. "

It primarily features tracks Jackson had been working on before he died, along with several songs dating from the <i>Thriller</i> era of 1982. Controversy will always arise regarding material that an artist couldn't have given final approval to, but the tracks here are consistent with the sounds and styles Jackson had worked with throughout his career. The list of producers and guest musicians is long and in keeping with the more-the-merrier approach Jackson employed after the <i>Bad</i> album ended his affiliation with producer Quincy Jones. \"(I Like) The Way You Love Me\" first appeared in a much different form on a 2004 career retrospective and is typical of the gorgeous melodicism that Jackson often explored. Akon shows up for \"Hold My Hand.\" 50 Cent is featured on \"Monster,\" and Lenny Kravitz worked on \"(I Can't Make It) Another Day.\" The album's final cut—\"Much Too Soon,\" from the <i>Thriller</i> era—is an orchestrated ballad that takes on greater poignancy with his tragic passing.",

                            "standard": "Released just a few weeks after his death, <i>The Stripped Mixes</i> features 11 of Michael Jackson's Motown hits, solo and with The Jackson 5, with much—but not all—of the instrumentation removed in order to emphasize the vocals. It's not an attempt at being \"unplugged\" or a cappella, but rather to present understated presentations of Jackson's best-known early work. (For a cappella versions, check out <i>Pure Michael: Motown A Cappella</i>.) There's still plenty of gospel fire behind \"Who's Lovin' You,\" while \"Ben\"—his first No. 1 solo hit—is made even lonelier in this context. The more upbeat material—The Jackson 5's \"I Want You Back,\" \"ABC,\" \"Never Can Say Goodbye\"—is interesting, especially for folks who wonder how records are made; key parts of the songs' arrangements are no longer obscured by the electric guitars and keyboards that dominate the original versions. This isn't for everyone, but anybody who loves these songs but has grown fatigued from hearing them so many times will cherish the opportunity to hear them anew."

The addition of rare, previously unreleased material from 1973 make this 32-track anthology an intriguing proposition. \"I Want You Back\" and \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" with The Jackson 5 illustrate the need for young Michael to get his solo career together, and early solo singles such as \"Got to Be There,\" \"Rockin' Robin,\" and \"Ben\" (his first No. 1 solo hit) assured everyone it was the right move. While nothing here prepared the world for the multidimensional pop and soul that Michael and producer Quincy Jones would unleash on the music world with 1979's <i>Off the Wall</i>, this collection still highlights the purity of Michael's golden voice as he runs through '70s-styled ballads and soul tunes."

Before Jackson's <i>Thriller</i>, MTV had been criticized for playing too few non-white musicians. Jackson gave the network no choice, offering up videos that were more like short films than stiff three-minute concoctions. This collection features 42 of Jackson's short films, including the John Landis–directed 14-minute \"Thriller\" and \"Black or White,\" plus the 18-and-a-half-minute film directed by Martin Scorsese for \"Bad.\" Other notable directors such as David Fincher (\"Who Is It\"), Spike Lee (\"They Don't Care About Us\"), Mark Romanek (\"Scream\"), Herb Ritts (\"In the Closet\"), and John Singleton (\"Remember the Time\") also made notable collaborations with Jackson. Just about every Michael Jackson video that one could want from the <i>Off the Wall</i> period onward is featured here, including 10 videos that had been previously unavailable for purchase. What an era it was!"

Stripping the weight of history from <i>Thriller</i> is a big job, but hearing the record as a statement in itself remains hugely rewarding. Seven of its nine original cuts were Top Ten singles, but more important is the way Jackson and producer Quincy Jones turned the singer’s obsessions into intricate, stunningly sung pop-funk. From the knowing humor of the title track to the dread of “Billie Jean” and “Beat It” and the irresistible cuteness of “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)” and “Baby Be Mine,” <i>Thriller</i> finds Jackson at an artistic height. A quarter century later, it still sells. And nostalgia is far down the list of reasons why. ",

As the first music released after Jackson's legal controversies had been made public, <i>HIStory</i> features a number of new songs that sound defensive, paranoid, and like a man in crisis. Even the nervous beats on \"They Don't Care About Us\" sound as jittery as the original lyrics, which had led to allegations of anti-Semitism and were removed at Jackson's expense. His cover of The Beatles' \"Come Together\" takes on added promise and bite. Sister Janet joins him for \"Scream,\" where their voices blend as one. R. Kelly's \"You Are Not Alone\" illustrates Michael's inimitable way with a ballad. Throw in such hits as \"Rock with You,\" \"Beat It,\" and \"Billie Jean\" on the other half, and <i>HIStory</i> is quite a collection."

Stripping the weight of history from <i>Thriller</i> is a big job, but hearing the record as a statement in itself remains hugely rewarding. Seven of its nine original cuts were Top Ten singles, but more important is the way Jackson and producer Quincy Jones turned the singer’s obsessions into intricate, stunningly sung pop-funk. From the knowing humor of the title track to the dread of “Billie Jean” and “Beat It” and the irresistible cuteness of “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)” and “Baby Be Mine,” <i>Thriller</i> finds Jackson at an artistic height. A quarter century later, it still sells. And nostalgia is far down the list of reasons why. This special edition includes “Someone in the Dark” from an <i>E.T.</i> story album, a “Billie Jean” demo, outtakes and numerous intriguing, amusing interview segments with Jones and songwriting collaborator Rod Temperton.",

After all, it was <i>Off the Wall</i>—Jackson’s fifth studio album—that signaled a new era had arrived for MJ. With producer Quincy Jones, young Jackson resculpted his music to be among pop's most innovative and exciting. From the irresistible grooves of “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” it was apparent that Jackson’s magic had modern, lasting potential. The follow-up album, <i>Thriller</i>, more than proved that point, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time. Each follow-up album was first compared to <i>Thriller</i> before being accepted as its own work, and albums such as <i>Bad</i>, <i>Dangerous</i>, <i>HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I</i>, the subsequent <i>Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix</i>, and finally Invincible all have defining moments that will continue to thrill future generations as Jackson is rediscovered by new audiences.",

It primarily features tracks Jackson had been working on before he died, along with several songs dating from the <i>Thriller</i> era of 1982. Controversy will always arise regarding material that an artist couldn't have given final approval to, but the tracks here are consistent with the sounds and styles Jackson had worked with throughout his career. The list of producers and guest musicians is long and in keeping with the more-the-merrier approach Jackson employed after the <i>Bad</i> album ended his affiliation with producer Quincy Jones. \"(I Like) The Way You Love Me\" first appeared in a much different form on a 2004 career retrospective and is typical of the gorgeous melodicism that Jackson often explored. Akon shows up for \"Hold My Hand.\" 50 Cent is featured on \"Monster,\" and Lenny Kravitz worked on \"(I Can't Make It) Another Day.\" The album's final cut—\"Much Too Soon,\" from the <i>Thriller</i> era—is an orchestrated ballad that takes on greater poignancy with his tragic passing.",

The reasons were many, but the pairing of new material with an album of greatest hits had blunted the public's perception of the set as a new release. So Jackson went back into the studio and remixed eight of the songs and added five new tracks. However, this only served to confuse the non-fanatic portion of Jackson's audience further. It's a shame, since Jackson shows no letup in intensity here. \"Morphine\" is tough and edgy and even more frightening in light of the circumstances surrounding his death. \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" is a solid club track, and the classic club mix of R. Kelly's \"You Are Not Alone\" brings a new dimension to one of the original album's best-known songs."

Gordy put his A-team together for Jackson's 1972 solo debut, and three U.S. hit singles—the title track, \"Rockin' Robin,\" and \"I Wanna Be Where You Are\"—justified his faith and efforts. The young Michael shows incredible vocal range on \"Maria (You Were the Only One)\" and sings Bill Withers' \"Ain't No Sunshine\" and Carole King's \"You've Got a Friend\" with sensitivity and craft, beyond the songs' obvious purpose to fill the album with popular hits of the day. The entire album has a consistent early-'70s feel; it's the commercial side of a sound that was often used for sociopolitical material by the adult soul music stars of the era. Jackson's take on The Supremes' 1967 hit \"Love Is Here and Now You're Gone\" and the in-house Motown track \"Wings of My Love\" are easy adaptations for him. "

It's not an attempt at being \"unplugged\" or a cappella, but rather to present understated presentations of Jackson's best-known early work. (For a cappella versions, check out <i>Pure Michael: Motown A Cappella</i>.) There's still plenty of gospel fire behind \"Who's Lovin' You,\" while \"Ben\"—his first No. 1 solo hit—is made even lonelier in this context. The more upbeat material—The Jackson 5's \"I Want You Back,\" \"ABC,\" \"Never Can Say Goodbye\"—is interesting, especially for folks who wonder how records are made; key parts of the songs' arrangements are no longer obscured by the electric guitars and keyboards that dominate the original versions. This isn't for everyone, but anybody who loves these songs but has grown fatigued from hearing them so many times will cherish the opportunity to hear them anew."

Before Jackson's <i>Thriller</i>, MTV had been criticized for playing too few non-white musicians. Jackson gave the network no choice, offering up videos that were more like short films than stiff three-minute concoctions. This collection features 42 of Jackson's short films, including the John Landis–directed 14-minute \"Thriller\" and \"Black or White,\" plus the 18-and-a-half-minute film directed by Martin Scorsese for \"Bad.\" Other notable directors such as David Fincher (\"Who Is It\"), Spike Lee (\"They Don't Care About Us\"), Mark Romanek (\"Scream\"), Herb Ritts (\"In the Closet\"), and John Singleton (\"Remember the Time\") also made notable collaborations with Jackson. Just about every Michael Jackson video that one could want from the <i>Off the Wall</i> period onward is featured here, including 10 videos that had been previously unavailable for purchase. What an era it was!"
